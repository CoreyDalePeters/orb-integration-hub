# Auth Flow Creation Changelog

## 2025-03-07

### Initial Setup
- Created feature branch `auth-flow-creation-feature`
- Set up feature context and documentation
- Initialized feature development

### Architecture Implementation
- Created directory structure for refactored authentication flow components
- Implemented password reset functionality in Cognito service
- Enhanced auth state management with additional steps for password reset
- Created main auth container component with proper component structure
- Implemented login and password components with responsive UI

### Code Analysis
- Reviewed the existing auth-flow component implementation
  - Current component handles too many responsibilities (monolithic)
  - Uses NgRx with basic store structure in place
  - Implements multi-step authentication process with Cognito
  - Has minimal error handling and user feedback
  - Missing password reset functionality
  - No clear separation of concerns between login/registration flows

- Analyzed current authentication services:
  - `CognitoService`: Handles AWS Cognito authentication operations
  - `UserService`: Manages user-related operations and database interactions
  - Services need better error handling and proper typed responses
  - Services need better documentation
  - Missing password reset service methods

### Implementation Plan

1. Refactor Auth Flow Architecture:
   - Break down monolithic auth-flow component into smaller, focused components
   - Implement proper routing for different authentication steps
   - Create dedicated components for each auth step

2. Enhance State Management:
   - Refine existing NgRx store structure for better state organization
   - Add missing action types for password reset
   - Improve error handling in effects
   - Add selectors for derived state

3. Missing Functionality:
   - Implement password reset flow
   - Add account recovery options
   - Enhance error messaging and user feedback

4. Component Structure:
   - Create container/presentational component pattern
   - Implement shared form components for reuse
   - Create dedicated route guards for auth flow steps

### Initial Implementation Tasks
1. Create directory structure for refactored components
2. Implement password reset functionality in services
3. Enhance the state management with additional actions and effects
4. Create basic UI components for each auth step

### Technical Decisions
- Will use NgRx for state management of authentication
- Authentication UI will follow Angular Material design patterns
- Will implement lazy loading for auth module components
- Will adopt a container/presentational component pattern for better testability
