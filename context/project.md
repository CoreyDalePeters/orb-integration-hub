Project: org-integration-hub (Title: OneRedBoot.com Payment Gateway)

Technology Stack:
- Frontend: Angular 18
- Backend: AWS services (AppSync, Cognito, DynamoDB, Lambda, Step Functions)
- Monitoring and Logging: CloudWatch
- Infrastructure as Code: CloudFormation
- Payment processors: Stripe (primary), with plans to add PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and others
- Authentication: Cognito with Amplify (future plans to add Auth0 and others)
- Backend language: Python 3.12
- Version control: GitHub
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

Roles:
- User: Everyone one of the following roles extends from this role.
- Customer: The end-user making a purchase through the client's website.
- Client: Our customer who uses the payment gateway service and needs a Cognito username to set up transactions.
- Developer: Works for the owner, has standard access to develop and maintain the system.
- Administrator: Works for the owner, has elevated privileges compared to developers.
- Owner: Has root level access to the entire system.

UI:
- The UI is designed to be simple and intuitive, with a focus on usability and accessibility.
- The color scheme is based on the OneRedBoot brand colors.
- The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- The UI components are reusable and follow best practices for Angular development.
- The main functions of the UI are broken up by Roles.
- - User: Signup, Signin, Confirm Signup, profile management
- - Customer: event registration, payment processing
- - Client: User management, event creation and management, transaction management, payment processing
- - Developer: Client and Customer management, error handling, logging, system monitoring
- - Administrator: Developer management, system configuration
- - Owner: Administrator management, root level configuration
- The app ui should be organized by roles and have a clear separation of concerns.

Naming Conventions:
- Angular Components: PascalCase (e.g., SignupComponent)
- TypeScript files: camelCase
- Python files and functions: snake_case

Development Approach:
- Step-by-step development
- Microservice architecture for easy integration with other websites

Deployment:
- Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Separate workflows for development and production environments

Project Description:
This payment gateway is designed as a comprehensive solution that can be integrated into various websites, providing a flexible and robust payment
 processing system. It leverages AWS services to ensure scalability, security, and ease of integration. The system allows for multiple
 payment processors, starting with Stripe, and is designed to be easily extensible for future payment methods.

The payment gateway will also allow for the administration, and authentication of users, and will provide a seamless experience for customers and clients

The final portion of the payment gateway will be to allow a client to create and manage events, and for customers to register for those events and make payments.

Completed Tasks:
1. Set up Angular 18 project structure
2. Installed necessary dependencies including AWS Amplify
3. Created basic components for signup, signin, and confirm-signup
4. Implemented AuthService with Cognito integration
5. Set up basic routing
6. Configured testing environment with Karma and Jasmine
7. Implemented the auth service (AuthService) with the following features:
   - User registration (registerUser)
   - Registration confirmation (confirmRegistration)
   - User authentication (authenticateUser)
   - User logout (logoutUser)
8. Integrated Amplify's GraphQL client for fetching user profiles
9. Implemented error handling and logging in AuthService
10. Created custom error types for better error management
11. Due to the expanded purpose (not just a payment gateway but a user, payment, event gateway should this project be renamed to reflect this?)
12. Implement the signin component logic using the AuthService
13. Create and implement the siqn-up component logic
14. Create and implement confirm-signup component logic
15. Set up protected routes using AuthGuard
16. Implemented the context-generator so we now have a way to update the projects context each time we commit

Next Steps:
17. Implement error handling and form validation in authentication components
18. Begin integration with backend Lambda functions
19. Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
20. Start implementing payment processing logic with Stripe
21. Update AppSync API to include the getUserProfile query and implement the corresponding resolver
22. Test the entire authentication flow from registration to login
23. Implement user profile management functionality
24. Begin work on integrating additional payment processors (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
25. Configure Multi-Factor Authentication in Cognito User Pool:
    - Enable MFA settings in Cognito
    - Configure SMS, email, and TOTP (app-based) options
    - Set up SNS for SMS delivery
    - Configure device tracking settings
26. Update AuthService for MFA Support:
    - Add MFA setup and verification methods
    - Implement device tracking functionality
    - Add MFA preference management
    - Implement remembered device handling
27. Create MFA UI Components:
    - MFA setup interface
    - MFA verification flow
    - Device remembrance options
    - MFA method selection
    - MFA management in user profile
28. Implement MFA Lambda Functions:
    - MFA verification handler
    - Device tracking management
    - MFA status checker
    - Device verification handler
29. Add MFA Security Features:
    - Rate limiting for MFA attempts
    - Bypass protection
    - Secure device token storage
    - Audit logging for MFA events
30. Test and Document MFA Implementation:
    - Unit tests for MFA components
    - Integration testing for MFA flow
    - Device remembrance testing
    - Update user and API documentation
